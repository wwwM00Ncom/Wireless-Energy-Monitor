# PCB for Smart Energy Monitor

This folder should contain your Altium Designer files for your PCB design.

> [!WARNING]
> Altium files are *binary* files rather than *text* files, meaning Git cannot easily track changes (at least not in a human-readable manner).
> 
> For your PCB work in Altium, you should take one of the following approaches:
> - if using branches, maintain a single Altium-specific branch until the design is complete;
> - if not using branches, assign one team member to do the schematic and another to the PCB afterwards; or
> - for the **safest option**, work on your Altium project outside of your Git repository and only commit it once it is finished.

> [!CAUTION]
> Merge conflicts betweeen binary files are **impossible to resolve** (without overwriting all changes from one version with the other version).
>
> This means that **it is imperative** that **anyone** who works on the Altium schematic/PCB artwork always:
> 1. `fetch`es and `pull`s any new upstream changes **before** beginning any work, and
> 2. `commit`s and `push`es their latest changes at the end of **every session**.
> 
> This is the only way to completely avoid merge conflicts.

> [!TIP]
> Ask a TA for help if either of the two warnings above do not make sense.
